next.js uses a pages directory for all pages. simply create a js file in the pages directory and the path becomes a url path

Linking pages 
import Link from 'next/Link'
<Link> allows client-side navigation and accepts props that gives better control over the navigation behavior 

Note: If you need to link to an external page outside the Next.js app, just use an <a> tag without Link.

static assets go in the public directory

next/image is an extension of the HTML <img> element. Next.js has support for Image Opitimization by default. allows for resizing, optimizing, and serving images

In addition to metadata, scripts that need to load and execute as soon as possible are usually added withing the <head> of a page.
